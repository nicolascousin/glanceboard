Glanceboard — Firebase Cloud Functions (Multi-User, Multi-Device).

Serverless image generation pipeline with subscription tiers:
  - Free (self-hosted): User runs their own Firebase project
  - Hosted ($3/mo): User provides their own API key, we host the app
  - Plus ($9/mo): Fully managed, server-side API key
  - Additional devices: $10/mo per extra display (paid tiers only)

Display hardware: Waveshare ESP32-S3 PhotoPainter (all-in-one e-ink frame).
Legacy Raspberry Pi + separate display is still supported but no longer primary.

Pipeline (per device):
  1. Fetch calendar events via Google Calendar API (OAuth refresh token)
  2. Fetch weather via Open-Meteo API
  3. Load character config from user's Firestore subcollection
  4. Build an adventure prompt (with weather context)
  5. Generate image via appropriate API key (user's or server's)
  6. Resize & dither for the 6-color e-ink display
  7. Save to device's Firebase Storage path (publicly accessible for the Pi)

Data model:
  User-level (shared across devices):
    Firestore: users/{uid}/settings/account  (API key, timezone, location)
    Firestore: users/{uid}/settings/subscription
    Firestore: users/{uid}/settings/google_tokens
    Firestore: users/{uid}/characters/{id}

  Device-level (per display):
    Firestore: users/{uid}/devices/{deviceId}  (name, aesthetic, model, calendar)
    Firestore: users/{uid}/devices/{deviceId}/prompt/prompt
    Firestore: users/{uid}/devices/{deviceId}/status/status
    Storage:   users/{uid}/devices/{deviceId}/display/*
    Storage:   users/{uid}/devices/{deviceId}/archive/*

  Legacy (pre-migration, still supported with fallback reads):
    Firestore: users/{uid}/settings/config
    Firestore: users/{uid}/settings/prompt
    Storage:   users/{uid}/display/*

- Do NOT mention snow, frost, or ice unless the temperature is below 2°C
- Do NOT include animals that don't exist in the location's region (e.g. no badgers, foxes, deer, or raccoons in Australia; no kangaroos in Europe)
- Focus on the sky, light, trees, atmosphere, and what people would wear
- If the location is known, use regionally appropriate vegetation (e.g. eucalyptus and gum trees for Australia, not oak and pine)
- Keep it to 1-2 SHORT sentences describing just the atmosphere and setting
- Do NOT mention specific people or characters

Example outputs:
- "A mild, cool winter morning{location_ctx} with grey overcast skies and green trees. The light is soft and gentle."
- "A bright, warm summer afternoon with clear blue skies and dappled sunlight through leafy trees."
