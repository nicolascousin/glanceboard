# Glanceboard Demo

**Glanceboard is an e-ink display that helps you start your day, built with Gemini**

This demo showcases how to use Gemini 3.6 Flash and Nano Banana to turn your Google Calendar into art on an e-ink display.

Using just a computer and an iCal feed, Glanceboard transforms your schedule, local weather, and custom family characters into Nano Banana generated art. Every morning, it reads your calendar and generates a fresh illustration so you know what's happening today, what to pack, and what to wear.

No screens. No notifications. Just a quiet picture frame that helps you know what's happening today.

**Note:** This demo was entirely vibe coded with Google Antigravity and uses off the shelf hardware.

## How it works

Glanceboard runs a lightweight local server on your computer (or a Raspberry Pi). Every few hours, it:

1. Reads your calendar events via iCal URL (universal standard for calendar data .ics file)
2. Fetches the current weather for your location
3. Builds a creative prompt for your characters
4. Generates an illustrated daily planner image from the above using Nano Banana
5. Dithers the image for 6-colour e-ink and serves it to your display

The display polls the server for new images — no cloud account needed.

## What you need

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [**Waveshare ESP32-S3 PhotoPainter**](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-photopainter.htm) | 7.3" colour e-ink display in a wooden frame with built-in WiFi |
| **USB-C cable** | For power (or use an optional lithium battery) |
| **A computer or Pi** | To run the Glanceboard server |
| **Python 3.9+** | Required for the server |
| **Node.js 18+** | Required to build the web dashboard |

No soldering. No ribbon cables. Just one display and a server.

> **Using a Raspberry Pi as the display?** The legacy Pi + separate e-ink HAT setup is still supported — see [Legacy Pi Setup](pi/LEGACY_PI_SETUP.md).

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/glanceboard.git
cd glanceboard

# Install server dependencies
cd server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Install and build the web dashboard
cd web
npm install
npm run build   # automatically creates src/config.js from template on first run
cd ..
```

### 2. Start the server

```bash
cd server
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) — the Glanceboard dashboard will guide you through setup:

- **API key** — Enter your Google AI Studio key (see [API key setup](#api-key-setup) below)
- **Calendar** — Paste your iCal URL
- **Location** — Set your timezone and location for weather
- **Art style** — Choose from 6 styles
- **Characters** — Add your family members and pets

### 3. Set up the display

See [Display setup guide](#display-setup-guide) below to flash and connect your PhotoPainter.

> **Want to keep it running 24/7?** See [Self-Hosting Guide](SELF_HOSTING.md) for systemd service setup, Raspberry Pi instructions, and running Glanceboard as a permanent home server.

## Suggested models

Glanceboard works with a range of AI image generation models:

| Model | Provider | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Nano Banana Pro** | Gemini API | **Recommended.** Best quality, text rendering, and character consistency. |
| **Nano Banana 2** | Gemini API | Balances speed with quality |

Glanceboard also uses **Gemini Flash 3.6** for intelligence:
- Rewriting calendar events into friendly language
- Generating weather-accurate scene descriptions
- Scanning calendars for important upcoming events

## API key setup

Glanceboard requires a **Gemini API key** to generate images.

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Click **Create API Key** → select your Google Cloud project (or create one)
3. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)
4. Paste it into the Glanceboard dashboard during onboarding

> **That's it.** The key is stored locally in your `server/data/config.json` file and used server-side to call the Gemini API.

## Display setup guide

### Step 1: Flash the firmware

1. Connect your PhotoPainter to your computer via USB-C
2. Open the [Glanceboard Web Flasher](https://raphdixon.github.io/glanceboard-firmware/) in **Chrome or Edge**
3. Click **Install Glanceboard Firmware** and select your device
4. Wait for the flash to complete (~2 minutes)
5. Unplug and replug the USB-C cable to reboot

### Step 2: Connect to WiFi and configure

1. After rebooting, the display shows a setup screen with the WiFi name `Glanceboard-XXXX`
2. On your phone or computer, connect to the `Glanceboard-XXXX` WiFi network (no password)
3. A setup page will open automatically (or go to `http://192.168.4.1`)
4. Enter your **WiFi network name** and **password** (leave password blank for open networks)
5. Paste the **Display Image URL** from your Glanceboard dashboard (found in **Settings → E-Ink Display Setup → 📋 Copy URL**) — it looks like `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000/images/latest_display.bmp`
6. Choose a **poll interval** (how often the display refreshes)
7. Click **Save & Connect**

The device will restart, connect to your WiFi, and begin polling for images. The display will update within ~60 seconds.

> **Tip:** You can reconfigure the device later by accessing its IP address from any browser on the same network. The IP is shown on the display after setup.

> **Using a Raspberry Pi as the display?** The legacy Pi + separate e-ink HAT setup is still supported — see [Legacy Pi Setup](pi/LEGACY_PI_SETUP.md).

## Email widget (optional)

Glanceboard can optionally show a summary of your unread Gmail on the display. This requires setting up your own Google Cloud OAuth credentials — see **[EMAIL_SETUP.md](EMAIL_SETUP.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

The email widget:
- Only reads subject lines and sender names (not email bodies)
- Summarises them via Gemini into a short digest
- Runs entirely on your own machine — no data leaves your server
- Is completely optional — everything else works without it
